A Brief History of Time#Stephen Hawking#library/images/book1.png#SCIENCE# A Brief History Of Time is Stephen Hawking's way of explaining the most complex concepts and ideas of physics, such as space, time, black holes, planets stars and gravity to the average Joe. so that even you and I can better understand how our planet was created. where it came from and where it's going.
Beyond Infinity#Eugenia Cheng#library/images/book6.png#SCIENCE# How big is the universe? How many numbers are there? And is infinity + 1 is the same as 1 + infinity? Such questions occur to young children and our greatest minds. And they are all the same question: What is infinity? In Beyond Infinity, Eugenia Cheng takes us on a staggering journey from elemental math to its loftiest abstractions.

Atomic Habits#James Clear#images/book4.png#SCIENCE# Atomic Habits is the definitive guide to breaking bad behaviors and adopting good ones in four steps, showing you how small, incremental, everyday routines compound into massive, positive change over time.
Quantum Mechanics#Hrabovsky & Leonard Susskind#images/book5.png#SCIENCE# In this follow-up to The Theoretical Minimum, Susskind and Friedman provide a lively introduction to this famously difficult field, which attempts to understand the behavior of sub-atomic objects through mathematical abstractions. Unlike other popularizations that shy away from quantum mechanics' weirdness, Quantum Mechanics embraces the utter strangeness of quantum logic.

Why We Sleep#Matthew Walker#images/book3.png#SCIENCE# Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity.
Geometry of Design Revised and Updated#Kimberly Elam#images/book12.png#ART# At last, a mathematical explanation of how art works presented in a manner we can all understand. Kimberly Elam takes the reader on a geometrical journey, lending insight and coherence to the design process by exploring the visual relationships that have foundations in mathematics as well as the essential qualities of life. Geometry of Design takes a close look at a broad range of twentieth-century examples of design, architecture, and illustration.  
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Douglas Adams#images/book11.png#FANTASY# On a hot night in August 1995 Douglas Adams gave a barnstorming performance to an invited audience at the Almeida Theatre in London. This compact disc is a record of that remarkable event. Douglas gives dramatic solo performances of episodes and passages from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything. Including: How to Fly! Arthur and the Irrational Sofa and much, much, .....more
